Still VERY early.

This is a CFWheels application that has the keyless_entry authentication code in it.
Eventually the authentication will be packaged as a plugin but the plugin system
in Wheels just isn't quite mature enough for that yet.

Alot of work still to come.


Contains CFWheels SVN revision 2045 code.


Table SQL - MySQL
-------------------
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `login` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(150) default NULL,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `createdAt` datetime default NULL,
  `updatedAt` int(11) default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=6 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8


Still To Do
--------------------
- Forgot password functionality
- Email activation
- Change password functionality
- Add check for rememberme cookie in the restrict access method
- Add ability to enable/disable user accounts
- Add basic roles
- Add OpenID authentication



2.28.2009
--------------------
Added restrict access method to parent controller file so it can be called
from any controller as a filter

Added password encryption to the user

Added unique validations on the login and email fields to avoid duplicates
