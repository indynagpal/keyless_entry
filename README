Still VERY early.

This is a CFWheels application that has the keyless_entry authentication code in it.
Eventually the authentication will be packaged as a plugin but the plugin system
in Wheels just isn't quite mature enough for that yet.

Alot of work still to come.


Contains CFWheels SVN revision 2045 code.
